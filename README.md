# HES-OFF
## Description

A research-based prototype tool in Python

## Installation

It is planned to add the `hes_off` package to the `pip` and `conda` package managers once the code is more mature. For the time being, it is possible to import the local `hes-off` package if your python script is within the HES-OFF project.

If you want to import the `hes_off` package from a python script located anywhere in you computer, you can add the location of the `HES-OFF` project to the `PYTHONPATH` environmental variable. Here are [some instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-so-it-finds-my-modules-packages) about how to create and modify environmental variables in Windows OS. In my case, the project was located at `C:\Users\rober\git\HES-OFF`
